# Reading_URL_Content

This file contain a python code for reading url content including text and images  using HTTP requests
_____

To run this code first open your terminal and write  'pip install requests'  and for python3 useres use  'pip3 install requests' 

 as I faced some problems raning the code at first with this error 'urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1049)'  so I used this trick 
 
    reopen your terminal and type   'pip install --upgrade certifi'  will if it did not work go to  applications / your python3.8 or your version file / open 'Install\ Certificates.command'
    
if both solutions did not work visit 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50236117/scraping-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error-for-http-en-wikipedia-org' and read the comments
